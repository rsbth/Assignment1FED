<h1> New Skills Learn't </h1>
<p>The assignment had been fun and was a nice refresher for HTML </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li> Adapting to the given framework </li>
<li> Requirement Analysis </li>
<li> Adding value despite being constrained with specified requirement </li>
</ul>
<h1>What's been easy ? </h1>
<p> Assignment wasn't a tough one actually but that is probably due to the fact that i already knew something. However, i found the requirement to be simple as it is short and not very time consuming.</p>
<h1>Problem Solving Strategy</h1>
<p>Yes and it is helpful</p>
